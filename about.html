                    <h1>Hi there, and welcome to my site!</h1>

                    <p>I'm Liesl, a Bioresource Engineering student entering my last year of study at McGill University. I'm so glad you've stumbled upon my page!</p>
                        
                    <p>A little about me: I began my studies as a Civil Engineering student, fueled by my passion for math and physics. However, I soon realized that I couldn't see a suitable path for me in the Civil Engineering domain, as I yearned to learn more about the environment, and how we as humans can better steward environmental health, alongside human existence. This lead me to transfer into Bioresource Engineering, a decision which has brought me immense joy and satisfaction. As I near my approach into the post-graduation world, I'm searching for my next mission.</p>

                    <p>I want to work towards building a better future for present and future generations. I want to move beyond outdated modes of operation, to embrace the possibility that lies beyond the current modus operandi. My current interests include habitat restoration, integrated water resources management, ecological agriculture, fermentation and mushroom cultivation. You can learn more about my interests, and previous projects on these topics, on the "My Projects" page!</p>
                    
                    <p>Thanks so much for stopping by my little corner of the internet; I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>

                    <p>- Liesl</p>
